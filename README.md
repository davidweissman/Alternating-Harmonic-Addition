# Alternating Harmonic Addition

Riemann's Theorem states that a conditionally convergent series of real numers can be rearranged to sum to any real number. Upon learning about this theorem during my freshman year of college, I decided to write a basic Java program that generates the alternating harmonic series and then uses it to sum to any real number it is given. 

Due to the memory limits of my laptop, I was only able to load the first 100,000,000 terms of the AHS. Because of this, the accuracy of the program declines dramatically around r = 9, where r is the real number being approximated.
